# Evolutionary-Neural-Network-Pathfinding
An evolutionary simulation with creatures that attempt to navigate towards a food source and are selected based on their ability to navigate. The creatures use a neural networks to navigate the environment. The neural network is updated by means of random mutations. After mutations occur across the creature population the creatures are set free in the environment to find the food. The creatures that are the worst at finding the food have their neural network values replaced by the neural network values of the creatures who are the best at finding the food. This process repeates and after a few generations the creatures become proficient at finding the food. The intresting part about this project that it is designed in a way such that it can be applied to any problem. The "animal" is an interchangable object whose behaviour is irrelevant. Meaning that no matter its goals/how it acts, an optimum behaviour will always be found. The only catch being that depending on the goal it may take an unresonably long time to find the optimum behaviour.
